# AutomatePDFGeneration
This Project is solving some automations in PDF generation:

**Problem:**
When users are exporting PDF from Quote or any PDF Export enabled table then there is no OOB way to automate the PDF name so I have created a Plugin which will automatically download and attach in note section.

**Solution:**
Created a Plugin and the Plugin will take the template name and template id with primary entity and it attach the document in notes section.
